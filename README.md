# We're In The Same Boat

"A river crossing puzzle is a type of puzzle in which the object is to carry items from one river bank to another, usually in the fewest trips. The difficulty of the puzzle may arise from restrictions on which or how many items can be transported at the same time, or which or how many items may be safely left together." - Wikipedia

In this puzzle game based on the classic riddle, the player must get a group of characters across a river making as few trips as possible.

This was an entry for the Game Off 2022 game jam, but the plan is to keep developing it to launch it on the Google Play Store.
