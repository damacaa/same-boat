  Descriptions:
  - "A mouse, a chicken, a cat and a sheep want to get to the island in the north,
    but they must cross a river first.\nThey have a boat with two seats but it can
    only drive for 15 minutes.\n   - A mouse takes 1 minute to cross the river.\n  
    - A chicken takes 2 minutes to cross the river.\n   - A cat takes 5 minutes to
    cross the river.\n   - A sheep takes 8 minutes to cross the river.\nWhen two
    or more characters are traveling together, the time they will take to cross the
    river is equal to the time that the slowest one of them would take.\nThe boat
    can\u2019t be moved if there isn\u2019t someone driving it.\nEven though they
    all want everyone to get to the other side in one piece, the animal instincts
    of some of them will kick in if they are left unattended.\nKeep in mind that:\n  
    - You can't leave a mouse and a cat together in the same island.\n"
